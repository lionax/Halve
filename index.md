# About Me

I'm Alex and currently studying computer science at Fulda, University of Applied Sciences writing my bachelor thesis right now - I'm writing about how to get bots smart enough to come up with interesting strategies in StarCraft Broodwar, just in case you wonder.

In the future there might arrive several articles here about stuff that I encounter or think that it is worth to share it. Actually I'll also put stuff here that's not interesting for you - things happen.

Currently I work for a small science project [ProGesture](https://progesture.org) where we build tool support for 3D human-computer gesture interaction, writing my bachelor thesis in machine learning and playing SysAdmin (or [BADASS](https://twitter.com/Ebastos/status/890949962967556096)) at the [General Students Committee](https://asta.hs-fulda.org) (I like that word - so official).

In the near future I'll probably found a startup for intelligent heating systems - [othermo](https://othermo.de).
